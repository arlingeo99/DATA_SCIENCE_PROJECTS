# DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECTS
This is my repository that would contain all projects, assignments and labs related to my Data Science program.
My first assignment is an article on the case study that I did on Costco where I designed a database for Costco Corporation. The Costco database is designed to manage and analyze key business operations, including member information, orders, transactions, and product inventory. It facilitates efficient tracking of sales and customer interactions, enabling data-driven decision-making for improved service and inventory management.
